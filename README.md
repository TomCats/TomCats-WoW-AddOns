# TomCat's AddOns for World of Warcraft

I have been creating addons for World of Warcraft since 2018.  Most notably are the TomCat's Tours addons.

All of my addons have been combined into one, now called 'TomCat's AddOn Suite'

You can install my addons via the CurseForge app, which you can get from https://curseforge.overwolf.com/ or view the description at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomcats

You will soon be able to view the sources for this addon here at GitHub.  Please keep in mind that these are not being distributed under an open-source license, but feel free to view for educational or auditing purposes.

If you would like to help support the ongoing effort, please consider sponsorship https://github.com/sponsors/TomCats
