        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r What causes an addon to be blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r Mostly this happens when the addon does something very innocuous but the Blizzard UI wasn't coded correctly to ignore the innocuous behavior.</p>
        <br />
        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r Is the addon trying to perform an action only available to the Blizzard UI?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r No. It is actually Blizzard's UI code trying to perform the action. The error message is very misleading.</p>
        <br />
        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r Why was the issue unforeseen?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r No reasonable amount of testing can uncover these kinds of issues nor are the tools available to predict and prevent them, but swift action can be taken when information is provided!</p>
        <br />
        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r What will you do with the information I provide?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r I will look through it for the root cause of the issue or for the next clue on what may be several rounds of debugging. Once a root cause is found, I will report the finding to Blizzard so that they may have an opportunity to fix it on their end.  Meanwhile, I will patch the addon so as to avoid the troubled section of the Blizzard UI.</p>
