It can be easy to lose track of which of a player's characters have already visited the holiday dungeon day to day <br/><br/>\r\n2. It's even more difficult to keep track of what each player's characters have done day to day when considering the daily quests, how many tokens and charms each character has, etc.<br/><br/>\r\n3. Players would like to be able to log in and immediately queue for the holiday dungeon without having to navigate through the group finder.  Ever accidentally queued for the regular dungeons instead?<br/><br/>\r\n4. Players would like to know what all of the available holiday rewards are, organized by category, and how to get them.  Out of these, players want to know which of the rewards they do not yet have.<br/><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 align=\"right\">|cffff575cContinued on the next page...</h2>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n" },

It can be cumbersome to scroll up and down a long list of achievements just to figure out which ones are left to do<br/><br/>\r\n6. Sometimes it is hard to get enough help from others to do some of the achievements which require a lot of help<br/><br />\r\n7. Players would like to learn about the various tips and other bits of information related to the holiday without leaving the game to go search for it</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p align=\"center\">And of course we will work toward ensuring that the interface is clean and easy to understand, (including improvements to readability with enhanced backgrounds)\r\n<br /><br />|cff00d8ff|HclubTicket:nlvbGvmib2a|h[click here for our in-game community]|h|r\r\n</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n" },
