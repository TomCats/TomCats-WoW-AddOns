        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r What is a discovery?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r Currently, these are any rare spawn/encounter or map icon type that TomCat's Tours is not yet
            aware of. What can be discovered will change according to what features are being worked on.</p>
        <br />
        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r Can I see what I've discovered before I send it to you?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r Yes! The discovery is base64 encoded (not encrypted) for ease of copy/paste. There are a
            number of tools and websites available to view what is in base64 encoded text, including base64decode.org</p>
        <br />
        <p>|cFFFFD100Q:|r I'm making a lot of discoveries. Can I disable this?</p>
        <p>|cFFFFD100A:|r No need. As the community submits their discoveries, each update to the addon will prevent anyone
            from discovering them again.  This will sort out on its own fairly quickly.</p>
